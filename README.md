# Text-data-sets--clustering
For a text data set, centroids of the clusters are represented 

An R representation of a text dataset that implements the following:

a.- Centroids of the clusters

b.- Decision boundary for 2 different classes


A.Centroids of the clusters
In this exercise, the k-means algorithm has been implemented
in order to exemplify the cluster selection and show the centroids
computation. First a dataset has been obtained regarding
”News Health”.

1.- Data acquisition
2.- Text mining initialization
3.- K-Means initialization

Plots are shown in the next figures, the ”arrows” denote the
centroids position:

B.Boundary between different classes

The classification problem is taken by considering a dataset that contains SMS messages,
either as spam or ham (not spam), and the Naive Bayes algorithm
is executed to illustrate the decision boundary. Some
modifications has been implemented and the corresponding explanation
is given in the following steps:

1.-Text mining: 
2.-Data preprocessing:
3.-Naive Bayes implementation
4.-Decision boundary

Finally,to illustrate the decision boundary, the predicted and
test values are shown in the corresponding plots, which can be
appreciated in the next figures:
